# Python Django Project Blueprint
## Goal
This project is intended to be a basic Python Django project start accelerator.
- If we have to frequently start new projects, despite Django being an amazing framework to develop web based applications, inevitably we end up repeating ourselves a lot on the initial phases, recreating a lot of boilerplate over an over.   
- And worst than that, we can find ourselves taking different approaches every time, leading to different styles, structures and choices for projects that should be look-alike in the same Team, project or company.
- So, is a good idea to have common bootstrap base.
## Disclaimer
- This project still an W.I.P. (Work In Progress).
- Use it if you want, however at your own responsibility.
- I'm happy to answer questions, however I  can't provide support.
  - If you want to rise any question, please use the `Github issues` section of the repository. 
- This project is opinionated and based on my own views.
  - Despite I did my best to follow all the best practices.
### Better alternatives
If you are looking for a more serious Django template project, consider using for example:
- [Cookie Cutter Django](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - Based on the fabulous [Cookie Cutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) project, by [Audrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audreyfeldroy/) and [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfeldroy/) Roy Greenfeld.
- The really nice [Django Layout](https://github.com/lincolnloop/django-layout/) from [Lincoln Loop](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lincoln-loop/).
  - As [Peter Baumgartner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbaumgartner/) refers in [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pbaumgartner_did-you-know-lincoln-loop-maintains-a-activity-7217314139809959936-7gSH/), "One issue with these templates is they tend to get stale as soon as you publish them."
  - Anyway, it is a nice exercise.
## Components

## Todo
- Make this blueprint parametrized, so we can customize the new project details automatically.
